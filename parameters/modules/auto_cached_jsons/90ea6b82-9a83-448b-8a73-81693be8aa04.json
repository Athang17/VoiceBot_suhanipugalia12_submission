  "original_question": "What is peer-to-peer lending?",
  "answer": "Peer-to-peer lending, also known as P2P lending, is a method of debt financing that enables individuals to borrow and lend money directly to each other without the use of a traditional financial institution as an intermediary. This is typically done through online platforms that match lenders with borrowers. P2P lending often offers more favorable interest rates for borrowers and potentially higher returns for lenders compared to traditional banking products. However, it also comes with increased risk for lenders, as loans are usually unsecured.",
