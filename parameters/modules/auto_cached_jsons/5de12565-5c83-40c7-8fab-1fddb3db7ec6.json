  "original_question": "Can I choose whom to lend to?",
  "answer": "Yes, you can typically choose whom to lend to when using peer-to-peer lending platforms or microfinance institutions. These platforms often allow you to browse borrower profiles and select specific individuals or projects to fund based on your preferences and risk tolerance. However, traditional banks and financial institutions usually don't offer this level of choice for individual lenders.",
