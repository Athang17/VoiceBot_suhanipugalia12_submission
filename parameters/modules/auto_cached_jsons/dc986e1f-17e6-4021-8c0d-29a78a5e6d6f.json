  "original_question": "Hi, what age do you start investing in stocks?",
  "answer": "There's no specific age requirement to start investing in stocks, but in most countries, you must be at least 18 years old to open a brokerage account independently. However, it's generally recommended to start investing as early as possible to take advantage of compound growth over time. \n\nBefore investing, consider:\n\n1. Financial stability\n2. Understanding of basic investment concepts\n3. Risk tolerance\n4. Long-term financial goals\n\nIf you're under 18, you can still learn about investing and potentially start with a custodial account managed by a parent or guardian.",
