Type of establishment: Prices at a local caf\u00e9 may differ from those at a chain like Starbucks or a high-end coffee shop.\n\n3. Type of coffee: Espresso-based drinks (lattes, cappuccinos) are usually more expensive than drip coffee.\n\n4. Size of the cup: Larger sizes cost more.\n\n5. Quality and origin of beans: Specialty or single-origin coffees are typically pricier.\n\n6. Additional ingredients: Syrups, alternative milks, or other add-ons can increase the price.\n\nAs a rough estimate, in the United States:\n\n- A basic cup of drip coffee might cost $1-$3 at a local diner or caf\u00e9.\n- At a chain like Starbucks, a tall (small) brewed coffee might cost $2-$3.\n- Specialty drinks like lattes can range from $3-$5 or more.\n\nPrices can be higher or lower in other countries or specific locations. For the most accurate pricing, it's best to check local coffee shops or chains in your area."
