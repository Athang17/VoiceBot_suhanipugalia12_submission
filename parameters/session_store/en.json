Type of establishment: Prices at a local caf\u00e9 may differ from those at a chain like Starbucks or a high-end coffee shop.\n\n3. Type of coffee: Espresso-based drinks (lattes, cappuccinos) are usually more expensive than drip coffee.\n\n4. Size of the cup: Larger sizes cost more.\n\n5. Quality and origin of beans: Specialty or single-origin coffees are typically pricier.\n\n6. Additional ingredients: Syrups, alternative milks, or other add-ons can increase the price.\n\nAs a rough estimate, in the United States:\n\n- A basic cup of drip coffee might cost $1-$3 at a local diner or caf\u00e9.\n- At a chain like Starbucks, a tall (small) brewed coffee might cost $2-$3.\n- Specialty drinks like lattes can range from $3-$5 or more.\n\nPrices can be higher or lower in other countries or specific locations. For the most accurate pricing, it's best to check local coffee shops or chains in your area."

Could you please provide more context or clarify what you're asking about? \n\nHere are a few possibilities:\n\n1. If you meant \"earthy scent,\" this refers to a smell reminiscent of soil, wet leaves, or other natural outdoor elements.\n\n2. If you're asking about \"earthly shut,\" this could be a typo for \"earthly shot,\" which might refer to a photograph of something on Earth.\n\n3. If it's related to coffee, sometimes \"earthy\" is used to describe certain flavor notes, but \"shut\" doesn't have a common meaning in this context.\n\nIf none of these are what you're looking for, please provide more information or context so I can better assist you."
