In diplomacy:\n   - The accepted code of behavior and courtesy in official dealings between governments or dignitaries.\n\n3. In computing and networking:\n   - A set of rules and standards that define how data is transmitted between devices or systems.\n   - Examples include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web browsing, or TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) for internet communications.\n\n4. In science and medicine:\n   - A detailed plan or set of steps to be followed in a scientific experiment or medical treatment.\n\n5.
