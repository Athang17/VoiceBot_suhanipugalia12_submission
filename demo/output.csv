"Peer-to-peer lending, also known as P2P lending, is a method of debt financing that enables individuals to borrow and lend money directly to each other without the use of a traditional financial institution as an intermediary. This is typically done through online platforms that match lenders with borrowers. P2P lending often offers more favorable interest rates for borrowers and potentially higher returns for lenders compared to traditional banking products. However, it also comes with increased risk for lenders, as loans are usually unsecured."

"Interest calculation typically works as follows:

1. Principal: The initial amount borrowed or invested.

2. Interest rate: The percentage charged or earned on the principal.

3. Time period: The duration for which interest is calculated.

4. Simple interest: Calculated only on the principal amount.
   Formula: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

5. Compound interest: Calculated on the principal and accumulated interest.
   Formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is principal, r is annual interest rate, n is compounding frequency, and t is time in years.

6. Frequency: Interest may be calculated daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually.

The specific method used depends on the financial product or agreement in question."
